	<ul>
		<li> Modern computer vision pipelines consist of data collection, labeling, training and deployment. </li>
		<li> In KI-Delta Learning we will also collect large amounts of data and we know that data
            collection has to be treated with care as it largely determines what our models can learn later on</li>
		<li> (KLICK) The main bottleneck in this pipeline is often the labeling of the data as it is very time consuming and costly </li>
		<li> This is an important problem and we believe that simulation can be key to solve it </li>
