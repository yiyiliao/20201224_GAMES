	<ul>
		<li> Our approach is inspired by representation recently introduced for 3D reconstruction tasks, namely neural radiance fields </li>
        <li> In contrast to voxel-based representations, we generate the radiance fields of scenes. </li>
        <li> But actually, what !is! a "radiance field"? A radiance field is a continuous function, that maps a 3D location and a viewing direction to a color value </li>
        <li> More specifically, we map a 3D location and a viewing direction to a color value and a volume density </li>
        <li> Then, similar to PlatonicGAN, we can use volumetric rendering techniques to project the 3D representation to an image </li>
        <li> This allows us to directly generate the 3D object, as opposed to the abstract 3D feature from HoloGAN.
            So in contrast to HoloGAN we can omit a learnable projection.  </li>
        <li> The generated images of our approach are multi-view consistent as indicated by the good reconstructions from COLMAP.
            And, as our representation is a continuous function, we obtain high image fidelity and good scalability to higher resolutions. </li>
        <li> I hope I got you all excited about our idea and also how it's relevant to the project, so you are curious to find out how we got this to work, because this is what I will explain next. </li>
